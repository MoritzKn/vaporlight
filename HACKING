Network protocol
----------------

This section is probably only useful if you want
to implement the actual low-level network protocol.
Check `vaporware/language_bindings/` - there may
already be a library for your language!

Open a TCP connection to the router
(default port: 7534) and send commands::

  <command> ::= <auth> | <set-led> | <strobe>

All commands consist of a 1-byte opcode and a payload.

First, you have to authenticate yourself using
the auth command and a 16-byte access token.
Shorter tokens are to be padded with 0x00 bytes.
Tokens have a priority defined in the server
config which determines rendering order::

  <auth> ::= 0x02 <token>
  <token> ::= <byte>{16}

Now, you can set LEDs to colors. The lowest
intensity is 0x00, the highest intensity 0xFF.
For the alpha channel, 0x00 means transparent
while 0xFF means fully opaque::

  <set-led> ::= 0x01 <led-id> <rgba>
  <led-id> ::= <high byte> <low byte>
  <rgba> ::= <r byte> <g byte> <b byte> <a byte>

Changes don't take effect until you issue
a strobe command, at which point they take
effect all at once::

  <strobe> ::= 0xFF
